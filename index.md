### About Us

## Marc De La Cruz

Howdy! My name is Marc De La Cruz and I am a Technology Management major from Houston, TX. I enjoy eating Nachos or Chicken Alfredo. Whenever I have some time for myself, I like to listen to music or play video games on my Xbox. An interesting fact about me is that my favorite shows to watch on Netflix include Outer Banks and Black Mirror. Another interesting fact is that I enjoy traveling. My favorite place that I went to would have to be Rome because I enjoyed learning about the history of the Roman Empire and I also liked the architecture of each historical building in that city.

## Neil Baker
Howdy, my name is Neil, and I am a technology management major from Colorado Springs, CO. I love me some Aggie football, and I headed to Colorado this past weekend to watch Haynes King get his leg broken in half, and to watch our offense score a grand total of 10 points on a mid-tier Pac 12 team. Fortunately, watching 20+ years of Aggie football will prepare you for dealing with disappointment, so it wasn't as infuriating as one might think. After spending several hours in Denver, I can confirm that CU Boulder fans are by far the worst I've come across, and I was in Baton Rouge for the 50-7 blowout in 2019. I'll leave it at that. Thanks.

## Marco Baeza
Howdy! My name is Marco Baeza and I am a Technology Management student from San Antonio, TX. I enjoy watching sports such as football, basketball, baseball, and soccer. Whenever I have free time I like to go on hikes, go to music festivals, travel, and play basketball. Speaking of basketball I actually tore my ACL playing basketball, which was not fun. I also like to cook. You can’t go wrong with some tacos. My favorite place to go in the summer is Chicago. Here is a picture of me there.

## Mason Ray
Howdy! My name is Mason Ray and I am a technology management major from Houston, TX. I enjoy long hikes and drinking on the beach. When I have some free time in my week, I play video games, cook, and listen to music. My favorite artist currently is Silverstein but my favorite song of all time is "My name is" by eminem. I would say that my favorite type of food would be sushi and my favorite type of drink is water. An interesting fact about me is that I have never broken a bone but I have gotten many stitches. If I won the lottery tomorrow, I would pay off all of my parents debts, my debts, buys some land in the rocky mountains and build a homestead. If I could travel anywhere in the world, I would vist Iceland.
